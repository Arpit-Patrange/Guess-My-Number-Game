# Guess-My-Number-Game

Guess My Number is a quick, fun, and easy opening game to lead with a small group or the entire class. Students try to guess the number you're thinking of in the fewest number of guesses possible.

# Why We Love Guess My Number
itâ€™s hard to think of a game more natural than Guess My Number. Kids can immediately start playing, and have a great time doing it. The game is also a perfect way to introduce the basics of logical thought and strategy, and let the game do the teaching with only minimal extra observations from the teacher. Surprisingly repayable and enjoyable, this is a great game to play early and often.

# The Launch
As you write the numbers from 1 to 20 down on the board, tell your students that you are going to think of a number from 1 to 20, and they will try to guess it in the fewest number of guesses possible. After every guess, you will tell them whether your number is greater or less than their guess.
